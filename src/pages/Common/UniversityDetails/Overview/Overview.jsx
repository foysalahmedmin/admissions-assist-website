          The Pearson BTEC Level 5 Higher National Diploma in Engineering offers
          students seven pathways, designed to support progression into relevant
          occupational areas or onto degree-level study. These pathways are
          linked to Professional Body standards (where appropriate) and can
          provide progression towards professional status or entry to the later
          stages of an appropriate degree. You will develop a sound
          understanding of the principles in your field of study, and learn how
          to apply those principles more widely. You will learn how to evaluate
          the appropriateness of different approaches to solving problems and be
          able to perform effectively in your chosen field. You will have the
          qualities necessary for employment in situations requiring the
          exercise of personal responsibility and decision-making.
